# Rick And Morty - Challenge

Thanks for taking the time to read my code, here I am just trying to do my best so if you have any good ideas to improve my code please let me know.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started with this project, you'll need to clone it to your local machine. You can do this using the following steps:

1. Copy the Repository URL: Click on the "Code" button at the top right of this repository page. In the dropdown, click on the clipboard icon to copy the repository URL.

2. Open Terminal (Command Prompt): Open your terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

3. Navigate to the Directory: Choose a directory on your computer where you want to store the project, and use the cd command to navigate to that directory. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/directory
```
4. Clone the Repository: Use the git clone command to clone the repository to your local machine. Replace your-username and your-repository with your actual GitHub username and repository name:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

5. Confirm Cloning: After running the above command, you should see the repository being cloned to your local machine. Once the process is complete, you'll have a local copy of the project ready for use.

Now you have successfully cloned the repository to your local machine! You can start working on the project or making changes to the code.
